### CubaseKeyCommands.html, CubaseGenericRemote.html

Single Page HTMl apps that convert the Cubase XML Format of the Keycommands preference file or an exported Generic Remote file to a pretty HTML display that can be printed or saved.

Download the zip file (https://github.com/janminor/cubase/archive/master.zip) to your computer, unzip and open the resulting folder.

You will need an xml file from Cubase as input.

For KeyCommands, the "Key Commands.xml" on Windows is in "%APPDATA%\Steinberg\Cubase 10.5_64"(or the respective version, e.g. "9.5_64").
On a Mac, look in “/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/[program name]/”.

For the generic Remote, you first need to export the config you want from the "Generic Remote" Dialog in Cubase.

Then just double-click in the HTML-File (CubaseKeyCommands.html or CubaseGenericRemote.html), open the XML File and go.
