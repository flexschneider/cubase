### CubaseKeyCommands.html, CubaseGenericRemote.html

Single Page HTMl apps that convert the Cubase XML Format of the Keycommands preference file or an exported Generic Remote file to a pretty HTML display that can be printed or saved.

The "Key Commands.xml" on Windows is in "%APPDATA%\Steinberg\Cubase 9.5_64"(or the respective version).
On a Mac, look in “/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/[program name]/”.

For the generic Remote, you first need to export the config you want from the "Generic Remote" Dialog in Cubase.

Then just double-click in the HTML-File, open the XML File and go.
